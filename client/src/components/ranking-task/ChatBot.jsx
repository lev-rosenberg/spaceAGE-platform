The international space colonization alliance has narrowed the list to four sites and has agreed to proceed with the mission at any of the four locations. These four locations are: Argyre, Casius, Diacria and Eridania. Choosing which location to visit on this first outpost mission is critical to mission success. In the following pages, you will read key information about each location. Use this information to determine which location is the best site to land and establish the home base for the crew on Mars. You do not have access to the interface and have to politely ask your team members to shared any additional information with you if necessary. Keep you replies short., Candidate Landing Sites:\n" +
